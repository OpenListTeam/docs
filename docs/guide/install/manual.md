## **Get OpenList**
Open [OpenList Release](https://github.com/OpenListTeam/OpenList/releases) to download the files corresponding to the system to be deployed. The latest version of the front-end has been packaged with the back-end, so there is no need to download the front-end files again.



The xxxx refers to the names corresponding to different systems/architectures, generally Linux-x86/64 is openlist-linux-amd64. 

If there is a prompt as followsï¼šIt is because [your GLIBC version is too low](../../faq/why.md#lib64-libc-so-6-version-glibc-2-28-not-found-required-by-openlist-or-accept-function-not-implemented), it is recommended to download the musl version

```txt
lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.28' not found (required by ./openlist)  
# or
accept: function not implemented
```



When you see the output of `start server @ 0.0.0.0:5244` and no error is reported afterwards, it means that the operation is successful. The initial password will be output when running for the first time. The program listens to port 5244 by default. Now open `http://ip:5244` You can see the login page, please see [WebDav](../webdav.md) for webdav.

## **Running**

Versions above v3.25.0 change the password to an encrypted hash value, and the password cannot be calculated directly. If the password is forgotten, it can only be re-**`randomly generated`** or **`manually set`**

@tab linux

```bash
# Unzip the downloaded file to get the executable file:
tar -zxvf openlist-xxxx.tar.gz
# Grant program execution permissions:
chmod +x openlist
# Run the program

# Obtain administrator information The following two different versions, the new version also has random generation and manual settings
# Versions lower than v3.25.0

## **Daemon**

:::::tabs#os
@tab linux
`vim /usr/lib/systemd/system/openlist.service` add the following content, where path_openlist is the path where openlist is located

```ini
[Unit]
Description=openlist
After=network.target
 
[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=path_openlist
ExecStart=path_openlist/openlist server
Restart=on-failure
 
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Then `systemctl daemon-reload`, now you can use these commands to manage the program:
- Start: `systemctl start openlist`
- Shut down: `systemctl stop openlist`
- Self-start: `systemctl enable openlist`
- Cancel Self-start: `systemctl disable openlist`
- Status: `systemctl status openlist`
- Restart: `systemctl restart openlist`

Daemon will not use? [**Video Tutorial**](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1rF41197Qv?t=187.0)

@tab macOS
Edit `~/Library/LaunchAgents/ci.nn.openlist.plist` in any way and add the following content, modify `path_openlist` to be the path where OpenList is located, and `path/to/working/dir` to be the working path of OpenList

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
     <dict>
         <key>Label</key>
         <string>ci.nn.openlist</string>
         <key>KeepAlive</key>
         <true/>
         <key>ProcessType</key>
         <string>Background</string>
         <key>RunAtLoad</key>
         <true/>
         <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
         <string>path/to/working/dir</string>
         <key>ProgramArguments</key>
         <array>
             <string>path_openlist/openlist</string>
             <string>server</string>
         </array>
     </dict>
</plist>
```

Then, execute `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ci.nn.openlist.plist` to load the configuration, now you can use these commands to manage the program:

- Start: `launchctl start ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ci.nn.openlist.plist`
- Close: `launchctl stop ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ci.nn.openlist.plist`
- Unload configuration: `launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ci.nn.openlist.plist`

@tab Windows

### **method one**

1.  Download the newest `nssm` from https://nssm.cc/download.
2.  Unzip the archive and go to the diretory of `nssm.exe`.
3.  Hold Shift and right click on the blank space, then release and press S or select "powershell here", you should now see a blue window named "Windows PowerShell".
4.  Type `.\nssm.exe install openlist`.
5.  Select the path of `openlist.exe` for "Path", e.g. `D:\openlist\openlist.exe`; type `server` for "Argument".
6.  You can custom "Display Name", "Description" and "Startup Type" in "Details" tab.
7.  Go to "I/O" tab and select a file for both "Output (stdout)" and "Output (stderr)", e.g. `D:\openlist\stdout.log`. The file itself (`stdout.log`) may not exist, but the folder (`D:\openlist`) must exist.
8.  Click on "Install Service".

You can now start the service from services.msc or task manager.

### **method two**

Use **`.VBS`** script to start and stop, create two scripts respectively start.vbs and stop.vbs

Just double-click to start it in the folder at the same level as the OpenList startup program, don't worry about no response, just go to the browser to access it

::: info Two startup scripts

**start.vbs**

```bash title="vbscript"
Dim ws
Set ws = Wscript.CreateObject("Wscript.Shell")
ws.run "openlist.exe server",vbhide
Wscript.quit
```

**stop.vbs**

```bash title="vbscript"
Dim ws
Set ws = Wscript.CreateObject("Wscript.Shell")
ws.run "taskkill /f /im openlist.exe",0
Wscript.quit
```

1. If the script will not be created, you can download it yourself: [**Script Download**](https://www.alipan.com/s/DHPMhRtKUzY/folder/63e0961eae317bd4d4d945cda69dbb00f9837fb7)

2. If the script will not be used, you can watch the video: [**reference video**](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1DG411s7j5?t=266.2)

How to realize Windows startup automatically, you can refer to the script mentioned above to use the video (second).

:::info
For all platform, you can use follow command to silent start, stop and restart. (v3.4.0 and later)

```bash
# start server with `--force-bin-dir`
openlist start
# stop server by pid
openlist stop
# restart server by pid
openlist restart
```

## **How to update**

Download the new version of OpenList and replace the previous one.

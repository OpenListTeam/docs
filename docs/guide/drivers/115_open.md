## 5. **Notes**

::: warning Handling Method for Token Leakage

If the Token is accidentally leaked, you can go to the 115 device login management to解除应用授权 (revoke application authorization).

- 115 APP: [iOS, Android] versions need to be ≥ 35.11.0
- 115 Web端: [https://115.com/?mode=device_manage](https://115.com/?mode=device_manage)

When it expires, the following content will be prompted:

```json
failed get objs: failed to list objs: code: 40140116, message: no auth
```

An account can obtain two `Refresh tokens` in the same application. After the third acquisition, the first obtained `Refresh token` will expire. Using the first `Refresh token` will prompt the above error.
